# TODO
- [ ] Create a get_observation function using the MSS library to capture the game screen.
- [ ] Run OpenCV on the result of the get_observation function to process the captured image.
- [ ] Use Tesseract OCR to detect game over screen by checking if the text "Game Over" is present in the processed image.
- [ ] Define a function to set reward for each ongoing frame, based on how long the agent has survived in the game.
- [ ] Use Stable Baseline3 to create a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model to learn how to play the game environment using the observations and rewards.
- [ ] Train the DQN model on the game environment using the processed observations and rewards.
- [ ] Evaluate the performance of the trained DQN model on the game environment.
- [ ] Fine-tune the DQN model and repeat steps 6 and 7 until satisfactory performance is achieved.
- [ ] Save the trained DQN model to be used to play the game environment.
